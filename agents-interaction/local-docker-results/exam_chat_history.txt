Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer:
(B) The debates between Robert Y. Hayne and Daniel Webster

Explanation:
The Nullification Crisis was a political crisis in the United States that occurred in 1832, when South Carolina passed a nullification ordinance that challenged federal tariffs. This crisis was caused by a variety of factors, including economic hardship, political polarization, and disagreements over states' rights versus federal authority. However, the most significant factor that led to the crisis was the debate between Robert Y. Hayne, a South Carolina politician, and Daniel Webster, a Massachusetts politician, over the constitutionality of state nullification of federal laws. This debate, which took place in a series of speeches in the Senate, highlighted the deep divisions within the country over issues such as states' rights, federal authority, and economic policy. Ultimately, the crisis was resolved through a compromise that raised tariffs on some imported goods while lowering them on others, but it highlighted the ongoing tensions between North and South over issues that would continue to shape American politics in the decades to come.
Correct Answer: E
