This directory contains the code for the agents-interaction project. The purpose of this project is to explore the 
innovative application of generative agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically focusing on Llama2,
to facilitate learning in American History. By leveraging advanced LLM capabilities, we simulate two distinct learning
methodologies—quantitative and qualitative—for agents and assess their effectiveness through standardized AP U.S. 
History test questions.
