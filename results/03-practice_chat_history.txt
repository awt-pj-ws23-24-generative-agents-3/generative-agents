Question: Why did Stephen Douglas support the idea of Popular Sovereignty when designing the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854? Choices:  (A) It guaranteed that 'free soilers' could exclude slavery from Kansas and Nebraska.  (B) It was outlined in the Constitution as a method for creating new states.

(E) It let the Congress decide on slavery in the territories. + Only one answer is correct. Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: D  

Explanation: Stephen Douglas supported Popular Sovereignty when designing the Kansas-Nebraska Act because he believed it was a fair way to resolve a difficult controversy. He wanted to avoid taking a strong position on slavery himself, and instead let the people of Kansas decide for themselves whether or not to allow slavery in their state. This approach allowed Douglas to maintain his political support among both pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups, while also ensuring that the controversial issue of slavery would be decided by the people who were most directly affected by it, rather than by Congress.

(E) restricted slavery in areas yet to be admitted as states. + Only one answer is correct. Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: E) restricted slavery in areas yet to be admitted as states.  
Explanation: Both the Northwest Ordinance and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 were significant documents that shaped the history of the United States, but they had different objectives and provisions. The Northwest Ordinance was enacted in 1787 to provide for the fair treatment of the Native American population, establish public schools in new territories, set guidelines on the number of new states to be established, and admit new states into the Union. On the other hand, the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was a political agreement that admitted Missouri as a slave state and banned slavery in areas north of the 36°30' parallel, which restricted slavery in areas yet to be admitted as states. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

Europe's population had grown significantly during the Middle Ages, and there was a pressing need for more resources such as food, land, and raw materials. This led many European powers to send expeditions to explore and colonize new territories in North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The desire to Christianize new lands (A) and the increased need for labor (B) were also factors, but they were not as pressing as the need for land and resources. The desire for an all-water route to the East (D) was a minor motivation, while religious freedom (E) played little role in European exploration during this period.

Question: Which is the BEST explanation for why the South lost? (A) They used slaves to fight. (B) They had poor generals. (C) They had weak support from the population. (D) They had too many deserters. (E) The war lasted too long. Choices:  (A) They used slaves to fight.  (B) They had poor generals.  (C) They had weak support from the population.  (D) They had too many deserters.  (E) The war lasted too long. + Only one answer is correct. Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: E - The war lasted too long.

Explanation:
The South lost the Civil War for a variety of reasons, and it is difficult to pinpoint a single cause as the "best" explanation. However, one factor that contributed significantly to their defeat was the length of the war. At four years, the conflict was longer than any previous American war, and it took a tremendous toll on both sides in terms of lives lost, resources depleted, and morale sapped.

The other options are not accurate explanations for why the South lost:

A) The use of slaves as soldiers did not significantly impact the outcome of the war, as most slave-states were reluctant to arm their slaves and many slaves escaped or deserted.

B) While some Confederate generals were certainly poor performers, others such as Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, and James Longstreet were highly skilled and effective leaders. The Union also had its share of incompetent generals.

C) The South did have significant support from the population, particularly in the early years of the war when many Southerners believed they could achieve independence from the North. However, as the war dragged on and casualties mounted, support for the Confederacy waned.

D) While there were certainly deserters on both sides, desertion was not a significant factor in the South's defeat. In fact, many Southern soldiers remained loyal to their cause until the very end of the war.

(E) were considered members of their master’s family. + Only one answer is correct. Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: D) came voluntarily.  

Indentured servants in colonial America were individuals who agreed to work for a fixed period, typically several years, in exchange for transportation to the colonies and other benefits such as food, clothing, and housing. While they were not paid wages, many indentured servants believed that their service would improve their economic prospects and provide them with opportunities for upward mobility. 

In contrast, enslaved Africans in colonial America were forcibly taken from their homes and brought to the colonies against their will. They were subjected to harsh working conditions, physical punishment, and separation from their families. Enslaved people had no legal rights or protections, and they could be bought, sold, and traded like commodities. 

Therefore, option D is correct because most indentured servants came voluntarily while enslaved Africans were forcibly taken against their will.

Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: D) the desire to make "the world safe for democracy."  

Correct! The U.S. entry into World War I was not motivated by a desire to make "the world safe for democracy" but instead, it was driven by several other factors such as the sinking of the Lusitania, interception of the Zimmerman Note, German violation of freedom of the seas and so on. 

Here are some additional details about each of these reasons:

A) The sinking of the Lusitania: On May 7th, 1915, a German U-boat torpedoed the British passenger ship Lusitania, killing over 1,000 people including 128 Americans. This event outraged the American public and put pressure on President Wilson to take action against Germany.

B) The interception of the Zimmerman Note: In January 1917, British intelligence intercepted a message from the German Foreign Office to Mexico encouraging them to declare war on the United States. This message, known as the Zimmerman Note, was published in the U.S. press and further inflamed anti-German sentiment.

C) German violation of freedom of the seas: Germany's decision to resume its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1915, which allowed German U-boats to attack any ship, including those flying the flag of a neutral country like the United States. This move was seen as a direct threat to American lives and interests.

E) The American commitment to the Triple Alliance: There is no such thing as the "Triple Alliance" in World War I history.
