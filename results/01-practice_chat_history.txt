Answer: D

Question: The implied powers clause of the U.S. Constitution was used to justify the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established a system of federal courts and provided for their jurisdiction over cases arising under federal laws. This act was signed into law by President George Washington on September 24, 1789.

The implied powers clause is found in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the enumerated powers of the federal government. The Supreme Court has consistently held that this clause gives Congress broad authority to pass legislation beyond the specific powers granted to it by the Constitution, as long as such legislation is reasonably related to the exercise of one or more of those enumerated powers.

The Judiciary Act of 1789 was passed pursuant to the implied powers clause because it was necessary and proper for carrying into execution the power of Congress to establish inferior tribunals, as provided in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The act created a system of federal courts with jurisdiction over cases arising under federal laws, including criminal cases involving violations of federal statutes.

The correct answer is: D) passage of the Judiciary Act of 1789.

Answer: E) restricted slavery in areas yet to be admitted as states.  
Explanation: The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820 were both significant documents that shaped the development of the United States. However, only one of the following statements accurately describes both documents.

The correct answer is E) restricted slavery in areas yet to be admitted as states. Both the Northwest Ordinance and the Missouri Compromise contained provisions related to slavery. The Northwest Ordinance prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory, while the Missouri Compromise allowed Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state but also prohibited slavery in any future states north of the 36°30' parallel.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of both documents:

A) Set guidelines on the number of new states to be established - This is not a correct description of either document, as they do not establish specific guidelines on the number of new states.

B) Admitted new states into the Union - Both documents did admit new states into the Union (Ohio and Missouri), but this is not the primary focus of either document.

C) Established public schools in new territories - The Northwest Ordinance did establish a system of education, but this is not a central provision of the document. The Missouri Compromise does not mention public schools at all.

D) Provided for the fair treatment of the Native American population - Neither document specifically addresses the fair treatment of Native Americans.

Question: President Andrew Jackson vetoed the Bank Recharter Bill because he Choices:  (A) was a Democrat and it was a Whig measure.  (B) disagreed with the Supreme Court decision in Marbury v. Madison.  (C) believed that paper money was the most important element for economic success.  (D) was opposed to the bank’s monopolistic power, calling it a “monster.”  (E) believed it was too late to bring up the question. + Only one answer is correct. Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: D  

Please explain why this is the correct answer and what evidence supports your choice?

I believe that the correct answer is D) because Jackson vetoed the bill due to his opposition to the bank’s monopolistic power, calling it a “monster.” This can be seen in his veto message where he states, "The bank...is unconstitutional...because it is a monopoly." Additionally, he argues that the bank's power to issue paper money and regulate credit is too great, giving it an unfair advantage over other banks.

All of the other options are not supported by the information provided in the question or Jackson's veto message. Option A is incorrect because while Jackson was a Democrat, the Bank Recharter Bill was not exclusively a Whig measure. Option B is also incorrect as there is no evidence to suggest that Jackson disagreed with the Supreme Court decision in Marbury v. Madison. Option C is incorrect as there is no mention of paper money being an important element for economic success in Jackson's veto message. Finally, option E is not supported by any information provided in the question or Jackson's veto message.
Correct Answer: D
