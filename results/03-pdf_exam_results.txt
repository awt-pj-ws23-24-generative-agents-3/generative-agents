Question: “Our government’s foundations are laid; its cornerstone rests upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white man, that slavery and subordination to the superior race is his natural and moral condition. This, our new government, is the first in the history of the world based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.... Our Confederacy is founded upon principles in strict conformity with these laws. This stone, which was rejected by the first builders, has become the chief stone of the new corner in our edifice.” —Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy, March 21, 1861 Which of the following is an accurate interpretation of Alexander Stephens’s statement?

Question: Which is the BEST explanation for why the South lost? (A) They used slaves to fight. (B) They had poor generals. (C) They had weak support from the population. (D) They had too many deserters. (E) The war lasted too long. Choices:  (A) They used slaves to fight.  (B) They had poor generals.  (C) They had weak support from the population.  (D) They had too many deserters.  (E) The war lasted too long. + Only one answer is correct. Answer only with the letter of the correct answer. 
Answer: E) The war lasted too long.  

Explanation: While all the other options are valid reasons for why the South lost, the most significant reason was that the war lasted too long and drained their resources. The North had a larger population and industry base to draw on, which allowed them to sustain the longer conflict. Additionally, the Union's naval blockade severely impacted the Confederacy's ability to trade and acquire supplies, further weakening their position over time.  

It is worth noting that all of these factors were interconnected, as the South's reliance on slaves (option A) contributed to their lack of industrial base and manpower, which in turn made it harder for them to replace losses and maintain a strong military presence. Similarly, poor generalship (option B) and weak popular support (option C) further exacerbated these issues. However, the sheer duration of the war (option E) was ultimately the deciding factor in the North's victory.
